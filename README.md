# mintlify-clone

📄 Project Description

This project is a static recreation of a modern documentation-focused landing page, inspired by the visual style and layout of the original Mintlify website.
The goal of this project was to closely replicate the design structure, typography, colors, and section layout using only HTML and CSS, strictly following the given constraints.
